# Index Construction

C and Ruby programs that touch on the index construction process of inverted index.

Both programs revolve around the document collection file called "cacm.all". The cacm.all contains text of documents from the journal *Communications of the ACM (CACM)*. There are altogether 3204 documents and 10446 terms. The file contains fields that seperate the terms. These fields are .I (for document ID), .T (for title), .W (for abstract), .B (for publication date), and A (for author list). The terms are extracted from the title and abstract.
